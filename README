pmMigratorPlugin
================

The `pmMigratorPlugin` is a symfony plugin that provides objects for performing
data migration.
You can create these objects for migrating from CSV file i.e..

Installation
------------

  * Install the plugin

    * Subversion

          [bash]
          $ svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/pmMigratorPlugin/trunk pmMigratorPlugin

Usage
-----

You can use pmMigrator objects everywhere. In this example, I will show you how
to create a Task that permform a migration from CSV file(s) to Propel objects.
This example is assuming that you have the schema.yml and the objects created.
Also, this example is assuming that you have a CSV file with the objects data.

  * Create a task

        [bash]
        $ ./symfony generate:task migration

        [php]
        $migrator = new pmMigratorCSV(
          // this should be the path to your CSV file
          sfConfig::get("sf_data_dir")."/csv/myCSVFile.csv",
          // Class name
          "Address",
          // Class fields: fill an array with all the columns. If any column is not used, fill in it with "null"
          array(null, null, null, null, null, "street", "number", "floor", "flat", "city_id", null, null, null, null)
        );

        // set hooks for "city_id" field. Any class field can have many hooks (or none)
        $migrator->setFieldHook("city_id", array("migrateTask", "getCityId"));

        // set hooks for the object
        $migrator->setObjectHooks(array(
          array("migrateTask", "guessStateId"),
          array("migrateTask", "guessZipCode")
        ));

        // migrate in debug mode.
        $migrator->migrate(false, true);

  * Move the CSV file to data/csv/ (not mandatory).


Field hooks
-----------

Any class field can have multiple hooks. Field hooks are callbacks that are
performed before the object is populated.

Field hooks are set with the setFieldHook($field, $hook), where $field is the
field name and hook is a valid callback.


Object hooks
------------

An object can have multiple hooks. Object hooks are callbacks that are
performed before the object is saved (but after the object is populated).

Object hooks are set with the setObjectHooks($hooks), where $field is the
field name and hook is a valid callback or an array of valid callbacks.
